---\n## Overview\nImplement runtime password generation and expand CI workflow for enhanced security and testing capabilities.\n\n## Problem\nCurrently, fixed or hardcoded passwords are used for admin and test accounts, introducing security risks. Also, CI does not comprehensively test all supported record types.\n\n## Solution\n1. **Random Password Generation:**\n   - Generate random, secure passwords at runtime for both admin and test user accounts.\n   - Ensure new passwords are generated for every CI test run.\n   - Adhere to robust password generation policies to maintain high entropy.\n\n2. **Integration Test Expansion:**\n   - Add create, update, and delete operation tests for all supported DNS record types.\n   - Dynamically validate password-based authentication for admin and test accounts during CI runs.\n\n## Expected Impact\n- Improve security by eliminating static or hardcoded passwords.\n- Enhance integration test coverage to ensure robustness.\n- Guarantee secure and dynamic authentication during CI operations.\n\n## Testing Requirements\n- [ ] Verify runtime password generation meets defined security policies.\n- [ ] Add CI workflow steps for CRUD operations on supported DNS record types.\n- [ ] Validate correct functioning of dynamic authentication processes.\n- [ ] Ensure full test coverage.\n\n## Effort\nEstimated time: 2 hours.
