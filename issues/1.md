## Overview
Implement runtime password generation and expand CI workflow for enhanced security and testing capabilities.

## Problem
Currently, fixed or hardcoded passwords are used for admin and test accounts, introducing security risks. Also, CI does not comprehensively test all supported record types.

## Solution
1. **Random Password Generation:**
   - Generate random, secure passwords at runtime for both admin and test user accounts.
   - Ensure new passwords are generated for every CI test run.
   - Adhere to robust password generation policies to maintain high entropy.

2. **Integration Test Expansion:**
   - Add create, update, and delete operation tests for all supported DNS record types.
   - Dynamically validate password-based authentication for admin and test accounts during CI runs.

## Expected Impact
- Improve security by eliminating static or hardcoded passwords.
- Enhance integration test coverage to ensure robustness.
- Guarantee secure and dynamic authentication during CI operations.

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify runtime password generation meets defined security policies.
- [ ] Add CI workflow steps for CRUD operations on supported DNS record types.
- [ ] Validate correct functioning of dynamic authentication processes.
- [ ] Ensure full test coverage.

## Effort
Estimated time: 2 hours.
