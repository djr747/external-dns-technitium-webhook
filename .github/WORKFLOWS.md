- GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) publishing

## 🔐 Security Features

### CVE Scanning

The pipeline includes multiple layers of CVE detection:

1. **Snyk** - Container, code, and dependency vulnerability scanning
2. **pip-audit** - Python dependency CVE database
3. **Grype** - SBOM-based vulnerability detection
4. **GitHub Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates

### Secret Protection

- **GitHub Secret Scanning**: Native GitHub protection
- **Snyk Secrets**: Container image secret detection

### Code Security

- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis (security-extended queries)
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Semgrep**: Pattern-based security rules
- **Snyk Code**: AI-powered vulnerability detection

## 📊 Reporting and Compliance

### Security Tab Integration

All security findings are uploaded to GitHub Security tab via SARIF:
- Navigate to **Security** → **Code scanning alerts**
- View aggregated results from all scanners
- Track remediation over time


Security reports retained for 90 days:
### Artifacts
- Snyk JSON/SARIF reports
- pip-audit CVE lists
- Bandit security findings
- SBOM files (SPDX + CycloneDX)

### Summary Reports

GitHub Actions Summary provides:
- Vulnerability counts by severity
- Test coverage metrics
- Build status and metadata

## 🔧 Required Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository settings:

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | Recommended | Snyk security scanning |

**Note:** No PyPI token needed - this project uses container deployment only.

## 📈 Versioning Strategy

### Version Tags

- **Release**: `v1.2.3` (semantic versioning)
- **Pre-release**: `v1.2.3-beta.1`, `v1.2.3-rc.1`

### Container Tags

Every build creates multiple tags:
- `latest` - Latest stable release
- `v1.2.3` - Specific version
- `v1.2` - Minor version
- `v1` - Major version
- `main-sha123456` - Branch + commit SHA
- `2024-01-15-sha123456` - Date + commit SHA
- `latest-patched` - Weekly security rebuild

### Change Tracking

- **Automated changelog generation** from git commits
- **Semantic commit messages** recommended:
  - `feat:` - New features
  - `fix:` - Bug fixes
  - `sec:` - Security updates
  - `docs:` - Documentation
  - `chore:` - Maintenance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Snyk Token Missing
If you don't have Snyk:
1. Sign up at https://snyk.io
2. Generate API token
3. Add as `SNYK_TOKEN` secret
4. Or disable Snyk jobs in workflows

### Build Failures
- Check **Actions** tab for detailed logs
- Review **Security** tab for vulnerability blocks
- Ensure all required secrets are configured

### Coverage Failures
Tests must maintain 95% coverage minimum:
```bash
pytest --cov=external_dns_technitium_webhook --cov-fail-under=95
```

Current project coverage: 99% (933/941 lines)
